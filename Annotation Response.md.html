<p>An interesting annotation that one my classmates made was “This is always a solution: let the public see the drafts of your work, but keep the final edit behind a paywall so as to not upset any publishers and still make money off of your work.” which was in reference to Michelle Moravec’s work. Moravec writes all of her books and papers publically, meaning her research notes and commentary are all online through google docs. She posts everything expect for the final draft so one could very easily follow her ideas, and locate sources through her notes but the published version is only accesible with purchase. This seems like a good middle ground in open access research. Considering a lot of publishers won’t publish work that has already been posted online for free. This way readers who cannot afford to purchase the research can still read it.</p>
