<p>Last term, I wrote an essay about the public’s reactions to finding out the truth of the Holocaust. To do this I shifted through newspaper articles in varying locations as well as locating journal articles about the topic. However I found that I ended up only using a few of the articles I found and with those only a few quotes. I did not as Michelle Morvac might have done, download hundreds of articles and run them through a program like Antcoc to locate commonly used terms to narrow down my search results. I instead became very overwhelmed with the amount of data I had at my disposal and ended up relying on the work of other scholars.<br>
Part of this had to do with the amount of time I had to write the essay since I only had a few weeks and also had four other essays to write. However now I realize all the ways I could have written that paper better.<br>
-reading at a distance then close reading, a mix of digital and human work,<br>
-search one word then the others surrounding it</p>
<p>In Michelle Moravac’s Corpus Linguistics she discussed using technology to narrow down primary sources by searching key words. For instance, she searched ‘women’ and ‘woman’ in a women’s sufferage book filled with many primary source papers on the tppic. She then read through the articles where those words appeared the most, finding the most relevant articles that way. This is a mix of digital and human work which I believe works the best. This way Moravec can spend more time connecting the dots between ideas, learning more about the topic at hand, etc instead of shifting through hundreds of documents.</p>
